# Dependency Record

This file is the authoritative record of why each third-party dependency is
present, who owns it, and which project phase first needs it. No dependency is
installed without an entry here. Versions are pinned in `requirements.lock`
when the P1 environment is created.

## P0 baseline

P0 uses only the Python standard library for governance validation. There are
no runtime or development package dependencies in this phase.

## P1–P3 dependencies

| Package | Version | Role | License / maintenance / security | First phase |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `numpy` | 2.5.3 | Numerical arrays for feature calculations | BSD-3-Clause; NumPy project maintenance; update through reviewed lock refresh | P1 |
| `pandas` | 3.0.6 | Indexed datasets and tabular transformations | BSD-3-Clause; pandas project maintenance; update through reviewed lock refresh | P1 |
| `pytest` | 9.1.1 | Test runner | MIT; PyPA/pytest maintenance; update through reviewed lock refresh | P1 |
| `ruff` | 0.16.9 | Static checks and formatting | MIT; Astral maintenance; update through reviewed lock refresh | P1 |
| `jupyterlab` | 4.6.4 | Reproducible research workspace | BSD-3-Clause; Jupyter maintenance; update through reviewed lock refresh | P1 |
| `ipykernel` | 7.4.0 | Notebook kernel | BSD-3-Clause; Jupyter maintenance; update through reviewed lock refresh | P1 |
| `setuptools` | 80.9.0 | PEP 517 build backend | MIT; PyPA maintenance; exact build pin in `pyproject.toml` and lock | P1 |

Adding or upgrading a package requires a purpose, a compatibility note, a
review, and an update to this record and the lock file.

The lock file also pins transitive packages required by the six direct runtime,
development, and research tools above. Transitives are not silently promoted
to direct API dependencies; their versions are reviewed as one lock refresh.

P4 adds no dependency; see DEPENDENCY_PROPOSAL.md.

## 2026-10-03 P3 capability decision (historical)

No plugin, MCP connector, provider SDK, broker integration, or additional
package is required for the requested P0–P3 delivery. The existing pinned
`numpy`, `pandas`, `pytest`, `ruff`, `jupyterlab`, and `ipykernel` environment
closes the demonstrated governance, ECB fixture/provider, feature, and factor
requirements. Installing unrelated integrations would expand the approved
scope without closing a measured capability gap. This record is historical; the
current P7 decision is recorded below.

## P5.5–P6 decision

P5.5 and P6 add no core package, plugin, or MCP server. The existing
`statsmodels==0.15.0` adapter remains admitted only in the isolated
`.venv-quant` environment; the primary `.venv` stays unpolluted. P6 reaches
the regression service through the Finahinking-owned normalized adapter seam,
never through a third-party object. PyPortfolioOpt, bt, vectorbt, Qlib,
Riskfolio, Alphalens, QuantStats/Pyfolio, LangGraph, Ollama, and live-data
providers remain deferred because no demonstrated capability gap requires them.

## P6.5 capability decision

P6.5 adds no package-manager dependency, plugin, MCP connector, provider SDK,
or host database service. The bounded BLS adapter uses the Python standard
library HTTP and hashing primitives; deterministic canonicalization and the
SQLite development adapter reuse the existing runtime, while Docker
`postgres:16-alpine` is used only as a disposable migration-verification
environment. The frozen P6 typed gateway, pandas fixtures, and existing
learning contracts are reused. A capability audit considered broader market
data connectors, browser/document extraction, production PostgreSQL drivers,
and agent frameworks; each was deferred because it would expand scope without
closing a demonstrated P6.5 gap. This decision is recorded in
`docs/p6_5/P6_5_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md` and the final validation report.

## P6.6 capability decision

P6.6 adds no package-manager dependency, plugin, MCP connector, broker SDK,
market-data adapter, ML framework, or database driver. Python `ast`, pandas,
NumPy, the existing P5/P5.5 ledgers, P6 learning contracts, and P6.5
provenance boundaries close the demonstrated feature/strategy/paper/export
gaps. The decision and residual capability risks are recorded in
`docs/p6_6/P6_6_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md`.

## P7 capability decision

P7 adds no package-manager dependency, plugin, MCP connector, graph/vector
database, broker SDK, or moderation service. Existing Python, pandas/NumPy,
SQLite/PostgreSQL migrations, and the repository's review/test tooling close
the measured capability gap. Installation is intentionally skipped; see
`docs/p7/P7_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md`.
